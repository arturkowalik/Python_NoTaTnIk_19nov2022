
	The Tao works like the greatest fountain,
	it functions perfectly and never overflows.
	All things spray out from it and return into it,
	it seems to be the origin of them.

	It blunts the sharpness of the powerful,
	untangle the knot of the powerless;
	softens the glare of the noble,
	and stays with the humble.

	Oh, it is hidden so deep that it seems not existing.
	I do not know its source,
	but I know it is the source of the Heavenly God.     

		~Laozi		Chapter 4, translated by Yuhui Liang
